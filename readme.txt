Using this WordPress plugin you can integrate WaaS with various checkout plugins like WooCommerce and Surecart.

== Description ==

Integration with WooCommerce and SureCart for InstaWP (WordPress as a Service) allows seamless e-commerce functionality within the InstaWP platform. This integration enables users to leverage the robust capabilities of WooCommerce and SureCart, empowering them to set up online stores, manage products, process payments, handle orders, and perform various e-commerce tasks directly through their InstaWP-powered websites.

Please note that this will create a unique WaaS Link for your customers when an order is placed via these checkout plugins, it will auto provision the website via the WaaS. To do that we are going to open our API soon.
